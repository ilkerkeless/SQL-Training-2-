SQL Practice Repository â€“ AdventureWorksDW2012  

This repository contains my SQL practice queries using the AdventureWorksDW2012 database.  
The main focus is to improve my data analysis and querying skills through:  
- Basic SQL (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING)  
- JOIN operations  
- Aggregations & filtering  
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  

Goal: Strengthen SQL knowledge for data analysis and business intelligence.
